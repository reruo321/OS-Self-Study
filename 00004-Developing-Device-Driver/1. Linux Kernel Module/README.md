# 1. Linux Kernel Module
We need to develop a Linux kernel module before developing a device driver.

* **Kernel Integration**: Linux Device drivers are part of the kernel, and need to be integrated with the kernel's core to interact with hardware effectively. Dynamic loading on a kernel module allows it to extend the functionality of the Linux kernel at runtime for the interaction.
* **Dynamic Loading**: When load and unload a kernel module dynamically, it does not need to reboot the system.
* **Kernel Space Access**: Device drivers operate in the kernel space instead of user space. It provides security and stability.
* **Isolation**: Since kernel modules provide a level of isolation from the rest of the kernel, we can recover its bug or crashes just by unloading the module.

## Steps
### 1. C Source Code for the Module
