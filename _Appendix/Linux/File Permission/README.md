# File Permission

We will discuss the file permission mainly into two parts:

1. [**File Mode Bits**](https://github.com/reruo321/OS-Self-Study/tree/main/_Appendix/Linux/File%20Permission/File%20Mode%20Bits): What permissions or permission behavior they can change?
2. [**File Permission**](https://github.com/reruo321/OS-Self-Study/tree/main/_Appendix/Linux/File%20Permission/File%20Permission): How do we see or change (1) *File Mode Bits* in Linux?

Here are other related Github documents of mine:

* [`chmod`](https://github.com/reruo321/OS-Self-Study/tree/main/_Appendix/Linux/Commands/C/chmod): The command to change the file permissions of a file/directory.
* [`chown`](https://github.com/reruo321/OS-Self-Study/tree/main/_Appendix/Linux/Commands/C/chown): The command to change the owner of a file/directory.
