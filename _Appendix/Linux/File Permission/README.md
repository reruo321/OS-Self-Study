# File Permission

We will discuss the file permission into two parts:

1. File Mode Bits: What permissions or permission behavior they can change?
2. File Permission: How do we see or change (1) file mode bits in Linux?

Here are other related documents of mine:

* [`chmod`](https://github.com/reruo321/OS-Self-Study/tree/main/_Appendix/Linux/Commands/C/chmod)
* `chown`
