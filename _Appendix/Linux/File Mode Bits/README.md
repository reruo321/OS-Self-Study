# File Mode Bits
There are two parts of the file mode bits:

A. File Permission Bits - Controls ordinary access to the file.
B. Special Mode Bits - Affects only some files.

Please read [here](https://github.com/reruo321/OS-Self-Study/tree/main/_Appendix/Linux/File%20Permission) together to understand how we can check them!

## A. File Permission Bits
A user can have three kinds of permissions for a file.

1. *read* permission
2. *write* permission
3. *execute* permission

## B. Special Mode Bits

1. set-user-ID bit (setuid bit)
2. set-group-ID bit (setgid bit)
3. Sticky bit
