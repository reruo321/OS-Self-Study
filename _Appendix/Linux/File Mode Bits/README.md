# File Mode Bits
There are two parts of the file mode bits:

A. File Permission Bits - Controls ordinary access to the file.
B. Special Mode Bits - Affects only some files.

Please read [here](https://github.com/reruo321/OS-Self-Study/tree/main/_Appendix/Linux/File%20Permission) together to understand how we can check them!

## A. File Permission Bits
A user can have three kinds of permissions for a file.

1. Permission to ***r**ead* the file
2. Permission to ***w**rite* to the file
3. Permission to *e**x**ecute* the file

## B. Special Mode Bits
