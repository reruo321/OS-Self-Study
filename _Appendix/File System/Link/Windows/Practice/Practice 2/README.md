# Practice 2
We made several kinds of Windows (NTFS) links from Practice 1.
Now we will see how links would change if their targets are moved or removed.

## TODO
Before doing these TODOs, see [this table](https://github.com/reruo321/OS-Self-Study/tree/main/_Appendix/File%20System/Link/Windows#links-in-windows) carefully and guess what will happen!

### 1. Moving Targets
1. Move the targets, "myfile.txt" and "mydir" to the "Desktop", or other directory.
2. See what happened to each link.
3. 
### 2. Removing Targets
1. Remove the targets, "myfile.txt" and "mydir".
2. See what happened to each link.
