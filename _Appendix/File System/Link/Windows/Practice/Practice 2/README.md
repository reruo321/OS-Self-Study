# Practice 2
We made several kinds of Windows (NTFS) links from Practice 1.
Now we will see how links would change if their targets are moved or removed.
You can guess the answers of the practice by checking [this table](https://github.com/reruo321/OS-Self-Study/tree/main/_Appendix/File%20System/Link/Windows#links-in-windows)!

## TODO
â€» We will use the files made from Practice 1.
### A. Tracking Information
1. Put a random file into "mydir". I put a file named "123.txt" as an example.
2. See information about the links carefully.

### B. Moving Targets
1. Move the targets, "myfile.txt" and "mydir" to the "Desktop", or other directory.
2. See what happened to each link.

### C. Removing Targets
1. Remove the targets, "myfile.txt" and "mydir".
2. See what happened to each link.
